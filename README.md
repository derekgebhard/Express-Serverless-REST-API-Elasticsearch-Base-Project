# Express-Serverless-REST-API-Base-Project
This project showcases how to build a REST API using Serverless and Express framework.
Using Expresss allows us to easily move the service from AWS Gateway and Lambda to
Docker and EC2 instances once scale is large enough where the money savings justifies
the infrastructure management overhead. This project also comes pre-setup with all
dependencies for great operations (linting, unit+integration tests, logs, errors,
metrics, alarms). Just needs to have routes and business logic added.
